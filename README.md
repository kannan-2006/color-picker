Interactive Color Picker

This is a clean, easy-to-use web app where you can switch up the page’s background color on the fly. It’s a quick example of how to play with the DOM, handle events, and build something that looks good on any device—all thanks to Bootstrap 4.

What you get:
Change the Background: Tap any color-coded hex button and the background shifts instantly.

See the Hex Code: The app shows you the exact CSS hex code for whatever color you’ve picked, right as you choose it.

Smooth Fade: Colors don’t just snap in—they fade smoothly, giving everything a polished feel.

Responsive Design: The layout centers itself both up-and-down and side-to-side, no matter what screen you’re using. Bootstrap’s flex utilities handle that.

Under the hood:
HTML5 keeps everything organized.

CSS3 handles the look and those smooth transitions.

Bootstrap 4 gives the layout its flexibility and makes sure it works on any screen.

JavaScript (ES6) powers the interactive stuff—changing colors, updating labels, and handling clicks.
